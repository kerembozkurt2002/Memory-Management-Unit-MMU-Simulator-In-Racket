# Memory-Management-Unit-MMU-Simulator-In-Racket

# Project Overview
This project is designed to implement a simple Memory Management Unit (MMU) simulator for a computer system. The MMU is responsible for translating logical addresses generated by the CPU into physical addresses that can be used to access the main memory. The project includes implementing various procedures to handle address translation using techniques like relocation and paging.

# Procedures
* **binary_to_decimal(binary):** 
Converts a binary string to its decimal equivalent.

* **relocator(args, limit, base):**
Translates a list of binary logical addresses to physical addresses using relocation and limit registers.
* **divide_address_space(num, page_size):**
Splits a logical address into a page number and page offset based on the page size.

* **page(args, page_table, page_size):**
Maps logical addresses to physical addresses using a page table.

* **find_sin(value, num):**
Computes the sine of an angle using the Taylor series expansion up to a specified number of terms.

* **myhash(arg, table_size):**
Calculates the hash value of a binary number using a customized hashing function.

* **hashed_page(arg, table_size, page_table, page_size):**
Maps a logical address to a physical address using a hashed page table.
* **split_addresses(args, size):**
Splits a stream of logical addresses into a list of addresses based on the specified address space size.

* **map_addresses(args, table_size, page_table, page_size, address_space_size):**
Maps a stream of logical addresses to physical addresses using a hashed page table.
